# Drop

Simply hit the space bar at just the right time to drop the package into 
the landing zone. If you hit the landing zone, it gets smaller for the 
next round.

You get up to 5 misses, and don't forget to take into account the wind (W)!

Inspired by "Test Pilot" by Rob Plass, originally written for Commodore PET.

## Key

`S: 100` - score
`L: 5` - lives
`W: 0.1` - wind
